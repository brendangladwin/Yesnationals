<!--Our Mission-->
    <div class="col-12 col-md-10">
        <div class="p-3">
            <h1 class="header">Our Mission</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="text-muted">At the heart of our endeavor lies a bold mission: to ignite the flames of curiosity and ambition in the minds of the next generation of scientists. Through our innovative and engaging workshops, crafted and led entirely by passionate college students, we strive to do much more than just teach scientific concepts. Our ultimate aim is to instill in young minds the belief that they hold within them the power to achieve anything they dream of.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Every workshop we conduct is a testament to our dedication to inspiring and empowering budding scientists around the world. We understand that the journey towards a career in science can often seem daunting, especially for those who may not have access to the resources or guidance needed to navigate them. That's why we go above and beyond to create an environment where students not only learn about the wonders of science but also feel encouraged to explore their own potential within it.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Central to our philosophy is the belief that diversity drives innovation. We actively seek to reach out to students from all walks of life, regardless of their background or circumstances. By celebrating human experience and showcasing the many ways in which science intersects with our daily lives, we hope to inspire a new generation of scientists who reflect the diverse perspectives and talents of our global community.</p>

<!--Our Values-->
    <div class="col-12 col-md-10 mb-1">
        <div class="p-3">
            <h1 class="header">Our Values</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="text-muted">Ensuring equal opportunity is at the core of our mission. We firmly believe that every child, regardless of their background or circumstances, deserves access to a quality education. We are committed to identifying and dismantling educational disparities wherever they may exist.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">Our dedication to equal opportunity permeates every aspect of our work. From the design of our workshops to the selection of our outreach locations, we prioritize reaching those who are often marginalized or underserved by traditional educational systems. We recognize that systemic barriers such as socioeconomic status, geographic location, and cultural factors can all contribute to disparities in access to education. That's why we proactively seek out partnerships and collaborations with organizations and communities that share our commitment to leveling the playing field for all students.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">In our pursuit of educational equity, we are acutely aware that addressing disparities requires more than just good intentions—it demands concrete action and sustained advocacy. That's why we invest time and resources into researching and understanding the root causes of educational inequities, so that we can develop targeted strategies for intervention and support.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">At the heart of our efforts lies a simple yet profound belief: that the potential for greatness resides within every child, waiting to be unlocked through the power of education. By working together to eliminate barriers and create pathways to success, we can ensure that every child on our planet has the opportunity to fulfill their dreams and contribute their unique talents to the world.</p>
